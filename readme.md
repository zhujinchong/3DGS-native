# 3D Gaussian Splatting in Python with NVIDIA Warp

This project reimplements the core ideas of 3D Gaussian Splatting in a clean, minimalist Python codebase using NVIDIA Warp. It runs on both CPU and GPU with no CUDA setup, focuses on clarity and parallelism, and is designed as a practical entry point for learning modern graphics and differentiable rendering.

## Why This Implementation?

### âœ… CPU & GPU with Zero Hassle

Thanks to Warp, the same kernel code runs seamlessly on both CPU and GPU â€” no need to deal with CUDA setup, driver issues, or device-specific kernels. Just flip one config line.

### ðŸ§  Learn Modern Graphics the Easy Way

Explore differentiable rendering and parallel graphics through clean, readable Python â€” no pricey GPUs, complex toolchains, or heavy C++/CUDA boilerplate needed.

### ðŸ“¦ Minimalist & Educational

This isnâ€™t another massive codebase. Itâ€™s designed for clarity and experimentation. Strips away complexity so you can focus on understanding how Gaussian Splatting really works.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/guoriyue/3dgs-warp-scratch.git
cd 3dgs-warp-scratch

# Install dependencies
pip install warp-lang==1.7.0 numpy==1.26.4 matplotlib==3.9.2 imageio==2.34.1 tqdm==4.66.5 plyfile torch==2.6.0
```

### Download Example Data

```bash
# Download the Lego dataset
bash download_example_data.sh
```


### Rendering

```bash
# Render 3 Gaussian points â€“ a minimalist example
python render.py
```
You should see 3 Gaussian points like:

### Training

```bash
# Train on Lego dataset (CPU by default)
# For GPU training, change DEVICE in config.py to "cuda"
python train.py
```

```

`forward.py` and `backward.py` are based on [graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). The original pure CUDA version is now reimplemented in Nvidia Warp, easy to understand, set up, and run.

Densification and pruning logic is based on [yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning](https://github.com/yzslab/gaussian-splatting-lightning), but restructured here with minimal data preparation and simplified training logic.
